                <p>Hello, I'm Christian, a recent graduate from the UNCC Coding Bootcamp, eager to make my mark in the tech world. What sets me apart is my unique blend of expertise in both tech and dentistry. With 8 years of experience in the dental field, including 3 years specializing in dental tech and software systems, I bring a holistic perspective to problem-solving. I'm passionate about crafting logical solutions for real-world challenges at the intersection of technology and dentistry.

                    I'm especially excited about the current surge in digital dentistry, which is revolutionizing the field. This dynamic shift opens up new avenues for innovation and problem-solving.
                    
                    Outside of work, I'm a devoted mother and an avid outdoors enthusiast. I find solace in hiking, cherish lake days, and enjoy exploring new experiences. Additionally, I'm an avid reader, always seeking to broaden my horizons.
                    
                    I'm excited to leverage my extensive practical experience, combining chairside expertise with software know-how, to create user-friendly webpages and software systems tailored for dental practitioners. Let's collaborate and bring innovative solutions to life!</p>
